### Local IDE

Copy the folder `src-step-0` to `src`, open your favourite text
editor and run `npm start` (After running `npm i`, of course).

The folder includes:

-   `utils` folder: Includes what you don't know where to put. In
    this case a map of notes to frequencies and a piano sprite.
-   `index.js`: starting point
-   `styles.css`: Includes all the styles you will need to
    allow you to focus in the React part.
